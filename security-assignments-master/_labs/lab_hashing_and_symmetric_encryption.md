# Part 1

## Polyalphabetic substitution and Transposition Ciphers 

1.  Using polyalphabetic substitution, with alphabet a–z (no caps), spaces translated to an underscore character (`_`), and a period (`.`, as the last character of the alphabet), use the private key `security` to encrypt the plaintext message:
     
         send_money
	
    To help you, use the following formula:
	
        Encryption: ciphertext = (plaintext + key) mod 28

        Decryption: plaintext = (ciphertext - key) mod 28
	
    Number your alphabet so that it starts with zero, e.g., `A = 0, Z=25, _ = 26, . = 27`. 
    This means that your alphabet will be `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_.`
    
    As a general rule for shift ciphers, *the modulus is always the size of the alphabet, but you must start your alphabet at 0*.
    
    You may use [an online vignere cipher calculator](https://cryptii.com/pipes/vigenere-cipher) to check your work.

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the ciphertext when encrypting "send_money" with the key "security" and alphabet <code>abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_.</code>?' %}
    
    
2.	Consider the transposition method discussed in class.  Assume the plaintext is
		
        attack postponed until two am
		
    and the key is `security`
        
    Create the ciphertext using columnar transposition (demonstrated in class). Remove spaces from the plaintext. 
    Pad the message so that there is an even block of characters, meaning that each column will have the same number of characters. 
    One way to do this is to pad the block by repeating the message a character at a time until the block is complete. Or, you can fill out the block with random letters from the alphabet. Show your result.

<div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Heads up!</strong> After completing this section, you should understand frequency analysis to the point that you are able to perform frequency analysis by hand on a short ciphertext.</div>

**Questions:**

1.  What are the four most frequent characters, in descending order? 
    Examine the frequency table chart at [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency_analysis). 
    What does this suggest the four letters identified correspond to?

    {% include lab_question.html question='What are the four most frequent characters?' %}

2.  Analyze bigrams and trigrams in the ciphertext. 

    What do the most frequent ciphertext bigrams suggest the three 2-length N-grams identified correspond to in English plaintext? 
    
    Also examine N-grams of length 3, and report the likely plaintext identities of the four 3-length N-grams reported. (Use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigram)).
    
    {% include lab_question.html question='What are the three most frequent trigrams?' %}
    
3.  Assume that a simple cipher that shifts all characters by a fixed number was used to create the cipertext. Given the results of the frequency analysis, what would the shift key have been (the shift to go from plaintext to ciphertext)?  
    Don’t be proud; you can use your fingers to count.   

    {% include lab_question.html question='What is the key of the ciphertext, counting forwards?' %}

4.  What is the plaintext?

    {% include lab_question.html question='What author is quoted in the plaintext?' %}
    
    
    
## One-time Pad

Decrypt the following ciphertext using the following one-time pads, using an XOR bitwise operation.

You may use an online tool such as [cryptii.com](https://cryptii.com). For example: 

![]( {{ '/assets/images/cryptii-otp.png' | relative_url }} )

Ciphertext (hexadecimal): `E0 C5 B5 B0 82 9A 8A DA B8 FD 8A 9E 67 5A 57`

# Part 2

## Hashing

Hash the following [plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmermann_Telegram) using multiple hashing algorithms.

    We intend to begin on the first of February unrestricted submarine warfare. 
    We shall endeavor in spite of this to keep the United States of America neutral. 
    In the event of this not succeeding, we make Mexico a proposal of alliance on 
    the following basis: make war together, make peace together, generous financial 
    support and an understanding on our part that Mexico is to reconquer the lost 
    territory in Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. The settlement in detail is left to 
    you. You will inform the President of the above most secretly as soon as the 
    outbreak of war with the United States of America is certain, and add the 
    suggestion that he should, on his own initiative, invite Japan to immediate 
    adherence and at the same time mediate between Japan and ourselves. Please call 
    the President's attention to the fact that the ruthless employment of our 
    submarines now offers the prospect of compelling England in a few months to 
    make peace.
    
    Signed, ZIMMERMANN

![]( {{ '/assets/images/cryptii-hashing-text.png' | relative_url }} )



**Questions:**

1.	What is the length of each of the following algorithm hashes in bytes? MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-512? How many bits does each hash represent? 

    (hint: how many bits are in one hex digit -- also called a 'nibble'? How many nibbles in the key? Or, How many bits in a byte, and how many bytes in a two-digit hex number like 'FA'? Review [this](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexadecimal_numeral_system) if you're still stuck)

    {% include lab_question.html question='How many bits are in an MD5 hash?' %}

Change just a single bit in content that you are hashing. e.g, change an “A” — 1010 to a B — 1011. Examine the hashes of the modified content. 
Since you only changed a single bit in a file of billions of bits, you might reason that the hashes would be nearly the same. Are they?

In cryptii, you can switch to a hex view thusly in order to make your single-bit-edit easier:

{% include lab_question.html question='If only one bit is changed on a 10 GB file how different will the hash be?' %}
{% include lab_question.html question='Which property of cryptographic hash functions is most related to the previous question?' %}

What is the plaintext of the message?

{% include lab_question.html question='What is the URL included in the plaintext you decrypted with AES?' %}


## Message Sharing

Use AES or another symmetric block cipher to encrypt/decrypt messages exchanged between you and another class member. You can use a site such as [cryptii.com](https://cryptii.com). 

You can generate a key and an IV from a password using the `openssl` tool, from your Kali instance, using a command such as the following:

    openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -P -pass pass:Password1 -nosalt
    
Where:

*   `enc` tells `openssl` to use its symmetric cipher routines
*   the block cipher is `aes cbc` with a block size of 256
*   the password from which the key and IV are derived is `Password1` 
    *   (in real life, please never use a password this weak!)
*   `-nosalt` tells `openssl` to not introduce randomness into the process of generating a key and IV from a password (in practice, you should let it use a salt -- more on this in a future lab)
*   `-P` tells `openssl` to: 
        
        -P  print out the key and IV used then immediately exit: don't do any encryption or decryption.
    
    (see `man enc`)
    
Key and IV in hand, you and your classmate can use cryptii.com to encrypt and decrypt.
