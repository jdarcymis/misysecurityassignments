# Setting up your virtual lab

I have created a Kali virtual machine image on Google Cloud Platform which is using nested virtualization to host within it several virtual machines: 
a Windows instance, a Metasploitable2 instance, and a security onion instance. They are hosted using `kvm` and `libvirt` and accessed using `virt-manager`.

Read [these instructions]( {{ '/tutorials/intro-to-gcp.html' | relative_url }}) to get oriented to and set up on Google Cloud Platform, and to get access to the Kali virtual machine. 
Anyone should be able to see and use the custom class kali image if they join [this Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/daveeargle.com/forum/#!forum/infosec-management) (public access):

## `infosec-net` Network Map

The network map is as follows:
        
<div style='width:40%'> 
    <table class='table'>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>IP Address</th>
                <th>Machine</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>192.168.55.101</td>
            <td>Kali (the host)</td>
        </tr>        
        <tr>
            <td>192.168.55.100</td>
            <td>Windows 7</td>
        </tr>        
        <tr>
            <td>192.168.55.102</td>
            <td>Metasploitable2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>192.168.55.103</td>
            <td>Security Onion</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
</div>

IPv4 network block in CIDR block notation: <code>192.168.55.0/24</code>


# Using the virtual machines within Kali

1.  The virtual machines are accessed using `virt-manager`. First, you should make
    sure that your user account is a member of the `libvirt` group.

        sudo usermod -a -G libvirt $(whoami)
        
    <div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Heads up!</strong> This will need to be run each time you create a new Kali instance.</div>
    
2.  Then, from a terminal, run `virt-manager` to get an interface such as the following:

    {% include image.html image='virt-manager-all-off.PNG' %}

    This shows that three virtual machines are available, but that none are running.

    <div class='alert alert-info'><strong>Virt Manager interface shows no vms?</strong><p>In the <code>virt-manager</code> interface, 
    try running:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code>File</code></li>
    <li><code>Add Connection...</code></li>
    <li><code>Connect (accept defaults)</code></li>
    </ul>
    </div>



## Starting and accessing virtual machines

3.  Start a virtual machine by selecting it, and pressing the "play" icon. The virtual machine should
    then update to show that it is running.

    {% include image.html image='virt-manager-running.PNG' %}

4.  To view the running virtual machine, highlight it and click "Open". A new window
    will appear.

    {% include image.html image='virt-manager-running-open.jpg' %}

    You can click into this window and interact with it via keyboard, and mouse if it has a GUI.

    {% include image.html image='virt-manager-running-open-interact.jpg' %}

5.  Details of a virtual machine can be viewed and edited from the "details" pane.

    {% include image.html image='virt-manager-running-open-details.jpg' %}

6.  A network is set up to enable the host (Kali) and the guests (e.g., Metasploitable2, Windows 7) to network with one another.
    Try `ping`ing metasploitable2 from Kali, and Kali from metasploitable2, using the network map ip addresses above.


    {% include image.html image='virt-manager-running-ping.jpg' %}


## Using snapshots

Virtual machines in `virt-manager` can be "snapshotted", which lets you restore the virtual machine to a previous state if you mess it up by doing something such as deploying malware to it.

To create a snapshot, **first, shut down the virtual machine**. Then, click the "snapshot" button on the virtual machine pane, then `+`, then set a name, and "Finish."

{% include image.html image='virt-manager-snapshots.PNG' %}


To restore to a snapshot, select your snapshot, and then "play" it. You do not need to shut down the virtual machine before restoring a snapshot.

{% include image.html image='virt-manager-snapshot-restore.PNG' %}



# Miscellaneous how-tos



## Disabling Windows Defender and Windows Firewall in Windows 7


### Disabling Windows Defender

Search for and open the Windows Defender dialog:

{% include image.html image='windows-defender-search-open.PNG' %}

Click the "tools" ribbon button, and then open the "options" menu pane:

{% include image.html image='windows-defender-tools-options.PNG' %}

Disable automatic scanning:

{% include image.html image='windows-defender-automatic-scanning-off.PNG' %}

Disable real-time protection:

{% include image.html image='windows-defender-realtime-off.PNG' %}

Then, click "Save".


### Disabling Windows Firewall

Search for and open the Windows Firewall dialog:

{% include image.html image='windows-firewall-search-open.PNG' %}

Click the "turn off-on" sidebar menu:

{% include image.html image='windows-firewall-turn-off-sidebar.PNG' %}

Turn off the firewall for both public and private networks:

{% include image.html image='windows-firewall-off.PNG' %}


## Install md5deep and sha256deep into Windows

*   From within your windows vm, [download md5deep-4.4.zip](https://github.com/jessek/hashdeep/releases/download/v4.4/md5deep-4.4.zip), and extract it.

    {% include image.html image='md5deep-download-extract-all.PNG' %}

*   Open the extracted folder, and dig down until you find the directory with all of the '.exe' files.
    {% include image.html image='md5deep-extracted.PNG' %}
    {% include image.html image='md5deep-copy-path.PNG' %}
    
*   Click in the Windows Explorer nav bar and select the current path. Copy it to the clipboard.
    
*   We want to be able to run these .exe files from anywhere within a `cmd` shell, so we will edit the accounts's `PATH` environment variable to include this directory. 
    *   Search for and open a dialog to edit the account's "Environment variables."
        {% include image.html image='windows-path-search.PNG' %}
        
    *   Create a new variable called `PATH`, and set it to the directory on your clipboard (just paste it).
        {% include image.html image='windows-path-new.PNG' %}
        
        *   If your account `PATH` variable already exists, then _edit_ it, and append your new path with a `;` delimiter after the current PATH string value.
    *   Open a new `cmd.exe` terminal, and confirm that you can run `md5deep` by passing an argument such as `-h`, e.g., `md5deep -h`. 
            
        If you do not get an error, then you have successfully added the md5deep .exe folder to your path.
        
        {% include image.html image='windows-md5deep-without-full-path.PNG' %}



## Enabling copy-paste for security-onion

If copy-paste is not working for security-onion, do the following: Shut down security onion. Then, from the "device info" menu for security onion (see above), 
"add hardware" bottom towards bottom-left > select "channel" use the default "spice agent." Start security onion again. This works because I already installed the `spice-vdagent` package into security-onion.

{% include image.html image='add-spice-channel.png' %}

# How I created the virtual machines

<div class='alert alert-danger'><strong>Heads up!</strong> Students in my class do <em>not</em> need to do any of the following! These are notes for creating from scratch the VMs that I have already provided to you!</div>

[TODO: fill out this documentation]




## Import base kali image into GCP

* Start with a [64-bit prepared Kali VirtualBox .ova from Offensive Security](https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vm-vmware-virtualbox-image-download/)
* Prepare it for importing into GCP following these instructions:
    * [Automated process](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/import/importing-virtual-disks). Or,
    * [Manual import](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/import/import-existing-image) and [manual optimization](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/import/configuring-imported-images)
        * Install the [guest environment](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/install-guest-environment)
        * Grab the `gce-disk-expand` package, too, from [here](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/compute-image-packages)
* Add the [nested virtualization license](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/enable-nested-virtualization-vm-instances)

## Customize Windows 7 Image

Windows 7 IE8 preview from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/)

    apt-get install rtorrent

* start with a developer preview Windows 7 VM from 
* change audio sampling to 48k
* install spice guest additions
* 	switch drivers to virtio
* set adapter 1 to static
* install microsoft office 2007
* install icecast
* run all windows updates
* add spice channel so that copy-paste works






In old versions, I installed:

* [WannaCry](https://github.com/fabrimagic72/malware-samples/tree/master/Ransomware/Wannacry)
* [IceCast 2.0.1](https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/xiph/releases/icecast/icecast-2.0.1.tar.gz)
* [Microsoft Word 2003](https://softfamous.com/postdownload-file/microsoft-office-2007/455/314/) (because it has an acceptable trial length, and because it is VBA-exploitable)
* Add a script that can pull down windows defender easily.
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)



## Customize metasploitable2

|-|-|
| username: | `msfadmin` |
| password: | `msfadmin` |


I don't remember. 
* For KVM, I think switch hard disk drivers and network to use virtio. 

The only change that I made was to the network interfaces so that they would connecto the `infosec-net`. If you want to make the same changes, do the following from within Metasploitable2:

    cat <<EOF >> /etc/network/interfaces
    auto eth0
    iface eth0 inet static
        address 192.168.55.102
        netmask 255.255.255.0
        gateway 192.168.55.1

    auto eth1
    iface eth1 inet dhcp
    EOF

    cat <<EOF > /etc/resolv.conf
    nameserver 192.168.55.101
    nameserver 8.8.8.8
    nameserver 8.8.4.4
    EOF

    /etc/init.d/networking restart



## Customize security onion

|-|-|
| username: | `securityonion` |
| password: | `Password1` |


Download and install Security Onion following [these instructions](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/QuickISOImage) and [these instructions](https://askubuntu.com/questions/64915/how-do-i-install-ubuntu-on-a-virtualbox-client-from-an-iso-image). [Make note](https://github.com/Security-Onion-Solutions/security-onion/wiki/Hardware): 

{: style='font-size:16px;'}
> If you just want to quickly evaluate Security Onion in a VM, the bare minimum amount of RAM needed is 3GB. More is obviously better!
	
* I gave mine a 15 GB hard disk.
* Give it two network cards. 
	* **Important:** Set Adapter 1 to "Host-only" or to "Internal Network", click the "Advanced" triangle, and (this is the important part) change "Promiscuous Mode" to "Allow All".
	* On the Adapter 2 tab, select "Enable Network Adapter," and select "NAT."
* I installed with username:password `securityonion:Password1`
* If you value your eyesight, [install VBox Guest Additions](http://www.binarytides.com/vbox-guest-additions-ubuntu-14-04/) to get fullscreen resolution (I had to run it twice).
* Once you have updated everything (`soup up`), double-click "Setup" on the desktop.
	* Choose "eth1" as the Management interface, and use DHCP addressing.
	* Choose "YES, configure sniffing interfaces," and use your promiscuous eth0.
	* Reboot, and double-click "Setup" again, this time skipping network configuration.
	* Choose "Evaluation" mode.
	* Accept the default monitoring interface (eth0).
	* For Squil, here's an easy-to-remember username:password -- analyst:analyst
* Obtain the files necessary for this lab:
	* `sudo mkdir /data && sudo chown -R securityonion /data && cd /data`
	* `wget https://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/refdata/SiLK-LBNL-05-nonscan.tar.gz`
	* `wget https://tools.netsa.cert.org/silk/refdata/SiLK-LBNL-05-scanners.tar.gz`
	* `gzip -d -c SiLK-LBNL-05-nonscan.tar.gz | tar xf -`
    * `gzip -d -c SiLK-LBNL-05-scanners.tar.gz | tar xf -`
* Install SiLK on Security Onion, [following this guide](http://www.appliednsm.com/silk-on-security-onion/), stopping before the "Configuring SiLK" section.
