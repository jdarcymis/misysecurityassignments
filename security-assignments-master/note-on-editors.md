title: A note on choosing a text editor to learn

---

Many of the security assignment labs require you to edit text files on a Linux machine. You'll want to become proficient in using a text editor.
For you young pups, I recommend `nano`. It's installed on all sytems you'll be using. Google around for some quick how-tos.

If you're feeling adventurous and want to be like me, consider learning `vim`. It has a steep learning curve, but oh what sweet power. Fire up `vimtutor` (type that in a terminal) and have fun . If you can't figure
out how to exit vim once you've started it, [you're not alone](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11828270/how-to-exit-the-vim-editor). (Hit `esc`, then type `:q!` then `[enter]`)
