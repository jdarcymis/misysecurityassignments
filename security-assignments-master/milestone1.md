Your assignment is to create a threat model and attack plan for the server you will attack as part of Milestone 2.

You will submit your report on Canvas.

# Objectives 

The server you will attack for Milestone 2 is a Linux server hosting web applications and at least one database containing customer data.

Your objectives are to:

1. Identify the types of sensitive information that might reside on the server that you will seek to extract.
2. Create a list of attacks your team will try against the server given what you have learned in the class so far.
3. Create one or more attack trees with "Gain access to server" at the base and at least five different types of attacks listed as nodes. For each node, indicate the difficulty of the attack (e.g., "easy", "medium", "hard"). The attack tree should help you prioritize your efforts.
