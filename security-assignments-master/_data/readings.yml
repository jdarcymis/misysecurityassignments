            The reading covers Anderson, either 2nd edition or 3rd edition:
              * [3rd edition: Anderson Ch. 3, pp. 90-97](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv3-ch3-sep16.pdf) (section 3.4–3.4.4.2)-, pp. 105-110 (section 3.4.9–3.4.12) 
              * [2nd edition: Anderson Ch. 2, pp. 31-39, 56-58](http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/Papers/SEv2-c02.pdf)
            
            If you read the 3rd edition, please also read this excerpt from the 2nd edition:"Regardless of how well passwords are managed, there can be absolute limits imposed by the design of the platform. For example, Unix systems used to limit the length of the password to eight characters (you could often enter more than this, but the ninth and subsequent characters were ignored). The effort required to try all possible passwords — the total exhaust time, in cryptanalytic jargon — is 96^8 or about 2^52, and the average effort for a search is half of this" (p. 58).
